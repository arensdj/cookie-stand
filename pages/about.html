    <br><p>First opened in 1st and Pike.  The salmon shaped cookies were inspired by their children's curiosity of the salmon fish stand at Pike Place Market.  Pat's wife Megan loved baking cookies and so she surprised her children with these uniquely shaped salmon cookies.  They were a hit!  On random days you may find his wife and children at one of our store locations.</p>
